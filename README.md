I'm not sure how well all this works, but it should. I haven't implemented a way for the computer to win without the player making some kind of error, so I'm still working on that.

In the compulsory move bit, there's also so many lines of code that are basically exactly the same, and whenever I look at it I cry. So if I ever do another update it will probably be to face those two issues.
